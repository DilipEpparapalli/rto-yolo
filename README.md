Real Time Object detection using yolo framework

This repository contains the implementation of real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework. The project explores the operational mechanics of YOLO and applies a pretrained model from the COCO database for object detection through a webcam.

The study extends to training the YOLO model on a custom dataset created with the Basys 3 board(honestly, it can be anything!!). The model's performance is evaluated on both small and large datasets, with a detailed comparison of the results. This repository includes all the python files, datasets needed to replicate the study and results.
